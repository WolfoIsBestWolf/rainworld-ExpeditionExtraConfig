Allows Unlock Tokens to appear in Expedition and makes Token/Pearl progress shared between main and expedition.

Feels wrong doing a Pearl delivery challenge just to not end up having it in your collection menu.

It's not shared in the normal game because Expedition uses it's own save file and they didn't add support for shared progress.
